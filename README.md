# Practical Unit Testing (Tomek Kaczanowski)
![Book cover](https://kaczanowscy.pl/img/cover_junit_2_150.jpg)

This repository contains my solutions to the Tomasz Kaczanowski book's - [Practical Unit Testing: with JUnit and Mockito (2nd edition)](https://kaczanowscy.pl/books/practical_unit_testing_junit_testng_mockito.html) - exercises.

The book focuses - as the title states - on testing. Although it touches on more universal topics like TDD, mocks, parameterization, or overall good practices (naming, custom matchers, utility methods, etc.), it specializes in Java's testing frameworks (here: JUnit & Mockito), thus readers seeking in improving their Java skills will benefit even more.

## Opinion
**Undoubtedly recommended.** Before taking up the book, I've had the basics of Java unit testing covered. However, it very quickly turned out that there is plenty more to learn. The book started very well and introduced challenging concepts gradually. It was a pleasant read, the author's writing was simple and succinct with some jokes here and there that I've found rather amusing than - which is more common in programming books - annoying.
