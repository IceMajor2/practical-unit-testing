Test cases for: public String reverse(String s) { ... }

- happy path: run test with a few typical strings (parameters)
  and expect to receive them reversed.
  For example:
	GIVE				|				EXPECT
	"hello"								"olleh"
	"I love Java"						"avaJ evol I"
	"I'm 21 years old"					"dlo sraey 12 m'I"
	"kayak"								"kayak"

- run the method with strings that are empty, but consist of whitespace characters.
  For example:
	GIVE				|				EXPECT
	"\n   \t"							"\t   \n"
	"\n\n\n\t"							"\t\n\n\n"
	"\t        "						"        \t"
	"             "						"             "
	" \r"								"\r "

- run the method with null as param and expect an IllegalArgumentException thrown

- run one test with a very long string and expect to receive it reversed in return

- include the string to have Unicode character specified as, for instance, 'U+0046'
